# easy-notebook-manager

A simple note app. The user must create an account, from which they can create notebooks (which are pages of infinite length) that autosave whenever they change its contents. They can then revisit their dashboard later, choose a notebook, and view its contents. The user should also be able to delete notebooks or delete their account
